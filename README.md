AGP 1


Given that my background is not in computer science I have worked hard on solidifying my fundamentals in C++.
Iâ€™ve tackled most of the challenges in the introduction section, ranging from simple conditional statements to pointers and overloaded functions.
Of particular interest was the Classes section, where I went through exercise that related to constructors, virtual functions, and virtual constructors.
I have also familiarized with notions of inheritance, multi level inheritance and accessing inherited functions.

The algorithms sections was a bit more challenging.

The goal was to achieve 400 points and I reached that in the C++ section, and added 120 on the algorithms section.


C++ CHALLENGES

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
